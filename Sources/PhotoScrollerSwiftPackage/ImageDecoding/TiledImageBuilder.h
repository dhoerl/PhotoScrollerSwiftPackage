 * This file is part of PhotoScrollerNetwork -- An iOS project that smoothly and efficiently
 * renders large images in progressively smaller ones for display in a CATiledLayer backed view.
 * Images can either be local, or more interestingly, downloaded from the internet.
 * Images can be rendered by an iOS CGImageSource, libjpeg-turbo, or incrmentally by
 * libjpeg (the turbo version) - the latter gives the best speed.
 *
 * Parts taken with minor changes from Apple's PhotoScroller sample code, the
 * ConcurrentOp from my ConcurrentOperations github sample code, and TiledImageBuilder
 * was completely original source code developed by me.

 *
 * Notes:
 * 1) How to use the "size" init parameter.
 *    You should set the height and width of the size parameter to the smallest dimension used 
 *    to display the image. For instance, if you will only display the image in a view of 200, 300,
 *    then use those numbers. If you support both landscape and portrait, then use 200, 200, since 
 *    at some point each dimension will have a minimum of 200 points. If doing full screen then the
 *    numbers will be 320,480 for portrait only, or 320,320 if you support multiple orientations.
 * 
 * 2) Orientation.
 *    JPEG images often have an "orientation" property which defines how the image is oriented.
 *    You can find references to this online, and will see that images can be rotated and flipped in
 *    one of 8 ways, with "1" being as laid out in memory. This class lets you define one of 9 values
 *    to orientation, 0-8. Use "0" if you want this class to look in the properties dictionary, and
 *    set orientation to the specified value (if any). Or, if you want to force an orientation, pass
 *    that value in during initialization, and the image will be forced to that orientation. For
 *    instance, set it to "1" to force the images to be shown as they are stored in memory.
 *
