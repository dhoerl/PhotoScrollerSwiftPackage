 * This file is part of PhotoScrollerNetwork -- An iOS project that smoothly and efficiently
 * renders large images in progressively smaller ones for display in a CATiledLayer backed view.
 * Images can either be local, or more interestingly, downloaded from the internet.
 * Images can be rendered by an iOS CGImageSource, libjpeg-turbo, or incrmentally by
 * libjpeg (the turbo version) - the latter gives the best speed.
 *
 * Parts taken with minor changes from Apple's PhotoScroller sample code, the
 * ConcurrentOp from my ConcurrentOperations github sample code, and TiledImageBuilder
 * was completely original source code developed by me.
